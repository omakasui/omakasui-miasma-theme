# Miasma theme for [Omakube](https://omakube.omakasui.org/) and Omadeb.

Dark, organic Miasma palette for [Omakube](https://omakube.omakasui.org/), with matching terminal, UI, and app themes plus a small wallpaper set. Based on [Omarchy Miasma Theme](https://github.com/OldJobobo/omarchy-miasma-theme) by [OldJobobo](https://github.com/OldJobobo)

### Preview:

## Installation

Use the builtin installation script:

```bash
omakub-theme-install https://github.com/Kasui92/omakub-miasma-theme
```

## Neovim note

`neovim.lua` checks for the official Miasma theme (`https://github.com/xero/miasma.nvim`). If it is not installed, it falls back to an Aether-generated Miasma variant bundled with this theme.
